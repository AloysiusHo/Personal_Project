# 👋 Hi, I'm Aloysius Ho

I'm currently an undergraduate student at **Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)**, pursuing a degree in **Robotics Systems Engineering (RSE)**. My academic journey blends **systems engineering principles** with hands-on robotics, software, and embedded systems development.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

My current project involves designing and deploying a fully autonomous robotic system using the **LIMO robot platform** and **ROS1 (Melodic)**. I’m integrating the full **ROS Navigation Stack** along with **RTAB-Map** for real-time 3D SLAM, mapping, and adaptive path planning in custom-built arenas inspired by real-world environments.

This project is part of a systems engineering course where I apply concepts from the **Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)**, including:
- System Synthesis
- Deployment & Use
- Product and Service Life Management
